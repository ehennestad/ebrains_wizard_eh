This folder will be populated with JSON schemas that are used by the RJSF (React Json Schema Form) library to render the Wizard input forms. The source schemas are available in the <a href="/templates/source_schemas"> source schema </a> folder.

The schemas in will be assembled during the setup. The following steps are done during assembly:
1. Controlled term instances from the KG are added as options to the relevant input fields
2. Text modules (small html snippets) are added to the relevant descriptions
